Alright bro, here’s the cleanest, **no-nonsense roadmap** you should follow to turn “Manoj bhaiya” from *zero-computer-knowledge offline teacher* → *tech-usable person who can actually earn online*.

I’ll keep it straight, practical, and beginner-friendly, but structured so *you won’t waste your time teaching junk*.

# ✅ **Phase 1: Make Him “Computer-Literate” (0 → 1)**

He’s a complete beginner, so first teach him the *bare minimum survival skills*.

### **1. OS Basics (Using Linux + GNOME)**

Show him:

He MUST become comfortable with:

Just this will boost his confidence.
